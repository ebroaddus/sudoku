# Sudoku
This is a simple sudoku game that I made for a course in Java at UPenn. Simply run the program from the command line with the Sudoku board input as a text file and you are on your way!

Note that this code heavily relies upon a custom UPenn library for drawing called PennDraw. In order to work, the code would need to be modified significantly before use OR the original PennDraw library must be found and implemented.
